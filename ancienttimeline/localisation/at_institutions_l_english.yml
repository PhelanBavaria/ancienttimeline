 desc_agriculture:0 "Since the beginning of humanity, humans lived hunter-gatherer lifestyles. These tended to be calorie-neutral, however agriculture changed this dramatically. The cultivation of crops and livestock drastically reduced the effort required to get food and led to a large surplus, meaning that not everyone had to work to produce food, allowing them to specialise and form societies and, eventually, civilisations."
 desc_writing:0 "As human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. Even millenia after its invention writing remains one of the most important requirements for the emergence of civilised societies and great technological and intellectual achievements would be impossible without it."
 desc_bronzeworking:0 "The first tools that humans made were made of stone, flint and wood. However, these were rather primitive. Beginning with the rise of Sumer in the 4th millenium BC, bronze began to be used. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, and was the hardest material available throughout the bronze age, ending in about 1300BC with the discovery of ironworking."
 desc_taxation:0 "Taxation originally emerged as a kind of protection money, the king was the strongest man in his village, and would threaten the locals for money. In exchange, he would stop other men from doing the same. As kingdoms grew larger, the king needed more men at his side, and these men became armies. The lands of the king became states, and the whole system became organised so that the people knew what they had to pay."

 desc_pantheon:0 "Ancient peoples have long worshipped minor local gods, spirits or ancestors, but as a state grows temples can become vital in holding communities together. An organised state pantheon means people throughout the land feel connected with each other and with the state."

 desc_caste_system:0 "Caste is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, ritual status in a hierarchy, and customary social interaction and exclusion based on cultural notions of purity and pollution. Its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of society into rigid social groups, with roots in ancient history and persisting until today. Sometimes, sociologists and anthropologists study the caste-like social divisions existing in various countries by using the Indian caste system as an analogical basis for research."

 desc_ancient_imperialism:0 "Imperialism is a policy that means extending a country's power through military and diplomacy. Its name originates from the Latin word imperium, which means to rule over large territories. Generally this means a multi-ethnic or multinational state with political and military dominion of populations who are culturally and ethnically distinct from the ruling imperial ethnic group and its culture. The Romans were the first nation to invent and embody the concept of empire in their two mandates: to wage war and to make and execute laws. They were the most extensive Western empire until the early modern period, and left a lasting impact on Western Europe."
 desc_legalism:0 "Legalism is a classical school of Chinese philosophy that groups thinkers crucial to laying the 'intellectual and ideological foundations of the traditional bureaucratic empire'. Often compared with modern social sciences, they have been regarded as having three tendencies: the enforcement of law, the manipulation of statecraft, and the exercise of power, articulating political technique that would ultimately form guiding principles for the Emperors of China. Highly effective in the short run, their dismissiveness of traditional culture, morality and anti-ministerial approach earned them enmity, causing them to be often overlaid with traditional ideology and customs."
